# Cartesian-System
Write a program that prints the quadrant (1, 2, 3, 4) of a point located in the Cartesian system.  The program needs to take the coordinates of the point (x,y). The first quadrant is when both coordinates are positive. Then the rest follow an anti-clockwise order.
Make another file to: 
Modify, in order that the entire program is terminated until the string EXIT is inserted.
